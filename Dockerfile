# Production image only: development goes through docker-compose.dev.yml.
#
# Only the last stage is shipped. The "-dev" images contain a shell, npm and run as root,
# which is why they are limited to the intermediate stages.
#
# Every stage uses the same Alpine release so that native modules match the runtime libc:
# argon2 ships a prebuilt musl binary, loaded without any install script.
